## About Omega

Omega is (obviously) in its extreme infancy stage; it hasn't even attached to the uterus lining yet. Be advised that everything has the potential to change as time goes on, but I'm planning to prevent any breaking changes as much as possible so I can maintain a singular backwards-compatible spec as opposed to Rust's tendency to break previous versions.

Omega is designed to be a general-purpose programming language. Sure, it'd be great if I can set it up so it can accept multiple programming paradigms (functional, OOP, etc) in order to ease adoption from developers of all flavors, but that's wildly ambitious at this stage.
