# Getting Started

## Installation

Currently, Omega is interpreted via a REPL built in Go, so you'll need to have Go installed on your machine. Please refer to the [Go download directory](https://go.dev/dl/).

After everything is installed, you can clone the Omega repository from GitHub:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Dishpit/Omega.git
cd omega
```

### Your First Omega Program

To get started with Omega, ensure you're inside the interpreter directory.

```bash
cd interpreter
```

Once there, simply run the following command to launch the REPL:

```bash
go run main.go
```
