## Welcome to Omega

Welcome to the Omega programming language!

Omega is a new language designed with simplicity and power in mind, and is self-described as The General Purpose Programming Language.

My goal is to provide a language that is easy to learn and use, while also being capable of performing just about any task necessary, no matter the complexity.

Omega is currently in its infancy, but I'm working hard to add features and improve the language.

This website serves as the primary source of documentation for Omega programmers.
