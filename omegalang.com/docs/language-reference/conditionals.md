# Conditionals

Conditionals are central to controlling the flow of code in Omega, allowing you to execute different blocks of code based on certain conditions.

In Omega you can use `if` and `else` statements to control the flow of your program based on Boolean expressions.

## Using Conditionals

In Omega, conditionals are written using the `if` keyword, followed by a condition in parentheses `()`, and the code block to execute if the condition is true enclosed in braces `{}`.

### Syntax

The basic syntax for conditionals in Omega is as follows:

```omega
if (condition) {
  // code to execute if condition is true
} else {
  // code to execute if condition is false
}
```
