# Variables

As of Omega v0.10.0, variables are dynamically typed.

## Variable Initialization

In Omega, you initialize variables using the following pattern: `var <name> = <value>`.

## Syntax

Variable initialization:

```omega
var my_integer = 42069;
```

## Data Types

Currently, Omega supports three basic data types: integers, booleans, and strings.

While arrays and hashes are possible and supported as of Omega v0.9, they're not usable as variables due to a current lack of variable and return data types.

## Examples

Declaring some variables with an initial values:

```omega
var weed_number = 420;
var sex_number = 69;
var is_hungry = true;
var hello_world = "Hello, Omega!";
```
