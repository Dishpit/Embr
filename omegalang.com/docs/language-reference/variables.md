# Variables

Omega supports variables as a fundamental aspect of the language, allowing you to store and manipulate data.

## Variable Initialization

In Omega, you initialize variables using the following pattern: `<type> <name> = <value>`.

## Syntax

Variable initialization:

```omega
int my_integer = 42069;
```

## Data Types

Currently, Omega supports three basic data types: integers, booleans, and strings.

## Examples

Declaring some variables with an initial values:

```omega
int weed_number = 420;
int sex_number = 69;
bool is_hungry = true;
str hello_world = "Hello, Omega!";
```
