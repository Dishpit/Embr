# Variables

Omega supports variables as a fundamental aspect of the language, allowing you to store and manipulate data.

## Variable Initialization

In Omega, you initialize variables using the following pattern: `<type> <name> = <value>`.

## Syntax

Variable initialization:

```omega
int my_integer = 42069;
```

## Data Types

Currently, Omega supports one basic data type: integers.

## Examples

Declaring an integer variable with an initial value:

```omega
int based_number = 42069;
```
