# But, wait! What about...?

...my favorite missing feature?

## ðŸš§ Active Development ðŸš§

Omega is still in its infancy.

In its current state, it's at the bare minimum to even be considered a useable programming language. It has a tiny handful of data types and another tiny handful of things it can do.

There are three paths forward if you need a particular feature.

### Path One

Wait for it to be developed.

We're currently a one-man operation, so this could take time, and it might not be a feature you had hoped for initially.

### Path Two

Build it out in the source code.

If you take this path, it officially makes you an Omega contributor! You'll be helping to develop the language and bring it to life even further, and the community will love you for all of eternity.

The only downside to this is that it could take time for the addition to get added into the source and become available.

### Path Three

Build it out in Omega! This will get your feature implemented a lot faster, though it will be fairly difficult to do given the current limitations of the language - you'll have to get incredibly creative.

Arrays, for example, can be built using the current basic data types, loops, and classes.

This method means you'll have your own custom implementation of a feature, but it'll be yours and yours alone... unless you decide to share your Omega code, that is!
