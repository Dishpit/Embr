          <h1>Welcome to OmegaByte: The First Hackathon for Omega</h1>
          <h2>Are you ready to explore the potential of a newborn language?</h2>
          <p className="omegabyte-copy"></p>
          <p className="omegabyte-copy">Welcome to <b>OmegaByte</b>, the inaugural hackathon dedicated to the Omega programming language! Omega is a burgeoning language with a minimal working feature set, initially offering only a couple of data types. This unique challenge will test your creativity, problem-solving skills, and ability to innovate within these constraints.</p>
          <p className="omegabyte-copy"></p>
          <h2>Prizes</h2>
          <p className="omegabyte-copy rules"><b>1st Place: $150</b></p>
          <p className="omegabyte-copy rules"><b>2nd Place: $80</b></p>
          <p className="omegabyte-copy rules"><b>3rd Place: $26</b></p>
          <p className="omegabyte-copy">The $256 prize pool is a nod to the importance of the number 256 in computing, reflecting the "byte" in OmegaByte and its ability to hold 256 values. This is a playful homage to the foundational role of 256 in computer science and highlights Omega's roots, which began with a maximum stack size of 256.</p>
          <p className="omegabyte-copy">Prize payouts can currently only be delivered via PayPal, Venmo, Cashapp, and Zelle.</p>
          <p className="omegabyte-copy"></p>
          <h2>Rules</h2>
          <p className="omegabyte-copy rules">1. All projects must be developed using the Omega programming language.</p>
          <p className="omegabyte-copy rules">2. There are no limits on what you can create. Let your imagination run wild!</p>
          <p className="omegabyte-copy rules">3. Given the minimal capacity of the language, this is an event for individuals only - no teams.</p>
